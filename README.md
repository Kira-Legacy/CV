# CV
(This article is before developing the whole webpage.)
Developing my Curriculum Vitae as a website using HTML and CSS. After developing the website, hosting it to the Internet. 

(This article is after the completion of the task.)
The final masterpiece of the webpage is done using HTML and CSS. It took a bunch of HTML and CSS lines of code to complete the project (since they are constantly evolving üòÅ). I have tried to make the website responsive for different viewports. It is a simple and basic carriculum vitae with no additional linked pages apart from the homepage. Give it a look!
As promised before completing the task, I have hosted the website.
